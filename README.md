# Arduino Door Lock System - A Smart and Secure Home Automation Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Arduino Door Lock System**! In this project, I demonstrate how to build a simple yet effective electronic door lock system using an Arduino. This project can be applied to various home automation scenarios, providing an added layer of security to your home or office.

 Key Features:
- Keypad Entry: Unlock your door with a 4x4 keypad for secure access.
- Servo Motor Locking Mechanism: A servo motor controls the physical locking mechanism.
- Password Protection: Set up a password for entry, providing an additional layer of security.
- LED Indicators: A green LED indicates a successful entry, while a red LED signals a failed attempt.

Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- 4x4 Keypad
- Servo Motor
- Jumper Wires
- LEDs (Green and Red)
- 10K Potentiometer (for controlling servo position)
- Buzzer (for audio feedback)

How it Works:
1. Keypad Input: The user enters the password using a 4x4 keypad.
2. Password Verification: The entered password is compared to the preset password in the Arduino code.
3. Servo Motor Action: If the password is correct, the servo motor is triggered to rotate, unlocking the door. If incorrect, the red LED lights up, and the buzzer sounds.
4. Security Feature: The system ensures that no unauthorized entry is possible by keeping track of failed attempts.

Code Explanation:
The Arduino code handles the logic of reading the keypad input, comparing it with the correct password, and controlling the servo motor and LEDs accordingly. The password can easily be modified in the code to suit your needs. The keypad is scanned regularly, and when the correct sequence is entered, the servo is triggered to unlock the door.

How to Build:
1. Connect the 4x4 keypad to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.
2. Attach the servo motor to the door lock mechanism.
3. Set up the LEDs and buzzer for status feedback.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino and test the system.

Benefits:
- Easy to assemble and customize.
- Great for learning about Arduino and electronics.
- Enhances the security of your home or office.
- The project can be easily expanded with features like RFID or Bluetooth-based unlocking.
